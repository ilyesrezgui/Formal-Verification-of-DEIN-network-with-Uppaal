This is a formal verification of the proposed network in the context of 5G networks that integrates Energy and Data transmission through the list of papers :
* Throughput Maximization and Fairness Assurance in Data and Energy Integrated Communication Networks
* Integrated Data and Energy Communication Network: A Comprehensive Survey
* Data and Energy Integrated Communication Networks for Wireless Big Data
* Joint Uplink and Downlink Resource Allocation in Data and Energy Integrated Communication Networks
* Distributed Batteryless Access Control for Data and Energy Integrated Networks: Modeling and Performance Analysis

We use UPPAAL for simulation and model checking and we study the enrgy aspect of the network: Energy consumption through data link transmission and energy harvesting through Radio Frequency(RF) electro-magnetic Signals.
